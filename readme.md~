#Rob's engine

##How to get started:

Setting up the engine isn't difficult if you have had experience with adding libraries to Eclipse (or any other IDE foor that matter). How ever if you haven't had experience with adding libraries to any IDE it should still be a piece of cake.
Don't worry, I'll help you out!


1. Firstly, we are going to need to install [Java](http://java.com)

2. Next, we will need to install [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (there is nothing stopping you from using a different IDE) Download Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers either 32bit or 64bit depending on your system.

3. Install Eclipse (it's only extracting the zip file so no actual installation is needed) and run it.

4. Set your default workspace (make sure you remember where this location is. By default it should be in your home directory in a folder called Home. Just make sure you remember it)

5. Download the tutorials [github page available here](https://github.com/robmadeyou/GameEngineTutorials) as a zip file.

6. Extract it to your Eclipse workplace.
